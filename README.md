## Refacture Code and Use Scout Clean
In this project a code was reviewed and the goal was to clean up the code and simplify the structure 
The problem was solved 

During this module chllenge I learned the funtionality of the div tag and how it is then targeted and styled with css

## HTML 
Changes were made on the "index.html" as the goal was to refacture the code without changing the styling or functionality of the website

### Tests
To make sure the functionality and the styliong of the website were not changed after committing my changes to the code i had both th original and my reviewed code opned up at the same time to make sure that when the chage was made, the website would look and function the same after the changes had been made
