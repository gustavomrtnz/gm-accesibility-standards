# Module 1 Refactored Code

## Refacture Code and Use Scout Clean
In this project a code was reviewed and the goal was to clean up the code and simplify the structure of the code without changing the functionality of the original website or the styling of the website.

During this module chllenge I learned the use of the div tag and how it is then targeted and styled with css

## HTML 
Changes were made on the "index.html" as the goal was to refacture the code without changing the styling or functionality of the website

Some changes include adding a main tag to wrap the main content of the website as well as added a section tag to group the related content 'benefit-....'

On the original website I noticed that a feature was missing when on the header contents when clicking the subheaders. When clicking on subheaders 'Online Reputation Manangement' and 'Social Media Marketing' it redirected the user to the contents on website but when clicking 'Search Engine Optimization' there was no feature to redirect the user to its assigned contents. I was able to fix this issue on the html by assigned an id a Unique ID to the class 'Search Engine Optimization.'

### Tests
To make sure the functionality and the styliong of the website were not changed after committing my changes to the code i had both th original and my reviewed code opned up at the same time to make sure that when the chage was made, the website would look and function the same after the changes had been made
